# Fictional-Dystopian-Government-Survey-Form
Project #2 from the freecodecamp responsive web design course.

I know this code will be all fucky, but I'm trying to make it look nice, at least for me, and meet the freecodecamp requirements.
I'll keep working on it until I can submit it, and hopefully I'll learn more about version control along the way.
